# Modeling and Simulation Portfolio
## Academic and professional Projects from Fall 2022 until Spring 2024

## Two-Year Summary

Over the past two years, I've been deeply engaged in the world of modeling and simulation through my work at the Study of Metacognition and Advanced leaRning Technologies (SMART) Lab and my commitment to volunteer activities. During this time, my focus has been on enhancing AI-human interactions, particularly in the domain of intelligent tutoring systems.

### SMART Lab Experience
At the SMART Lab, I contributed to several projects aimed at improving user interaction with AI systems. My role involved extensive data analysis, simulation of user interactions, and the development of models that predict and enhance learning outcomes. This hands-on experience not only sharpened my technical skills but also provided me with invaluable insights into the complexities of human-AI collaboration.

### Research Contributions
My research during this period led to significant contributions to the field, particularly in intelligent tutoring systems. I authored and co-authored several papers that were accepted at prestigious conferences:

- "Investigating Pedagogical Agents’ Scaffolding of Self-regulated Learning in Relation to Learners’ Subgoals" accepted at the [International Conference of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED)](./Papers_and_Presentations/AIED.docx) conference. Tokyo, Japan.

- "Gender Differences in Self-Regulated Learning Strategy Use in an Intelligent Tutoring System" accepted at the [European Association for Research on Learning and Instruction (EARLI)](./Papers_and_Presentations/EARLI.docx) conference. Macedonia, Greece.  

- "Examining Gender Differences in Self-Regulated Learning with MetaTutor " accepted at the [American Educational Research Association (AERA)](./Papers_and_Presentations/AERA.docx) conference. Chicago, USA.

Each of these papers underscored the potential of AI to transform educational methodologies through adaptive learning environments and data-driven insights.

I have also contributed to the making and presentation of research posters including:

- "Examining Gender Differences to Leverage Self-Regulated Learning Scaffolding in an Intelligent Tutoring System." Poster submitted and
accepted to the 2023 UCF Student Scholar Symposium. UCF, Orlando, Florida.

This period has been instrumental in shaping my understanding and expertise in AI-driven educational tools, setting a solid foundation for my ongoing contributions to the field of modeling and simulation.

## Volunteering and Leadership
Beyond the lab, I dedicate my time to volunteering with organizations that promote science and technology education. My efforts are particularly focused on inspiring young students to explore and embrace technology, specifically artificial intelligence, as a crucial tool for problem-solving and innovation. As part of my commitment, I actively participated in National Center for Simulation events, representing them at major Modeling & Simulation (M&S) conferences. This included playing a key role in assisting with the annual Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation, and Education Conference (I/ITSEC) for 2022 and 2023, as well as contributing to the Florida Simulation Summit in April 2024. These experiences allowed me to contribute to the field's growth while fostering connections between educational initiatives and the broader simulation community.

## Key Projects

1. ### Project A: Multimedia Language Acquisition Research

#### Overview
This project leverages a rich array of multimedia tools—including PowerPoint presentations, websites, audio, and video content—to elucidate my research on language acquisition. The goal was to create an accessible and engaging educational resource that highlights the importance and intricacies of how we acquire languages.

#### Details
The multimedia approach was carefully chosen to cater to diverse learning styles, enabling a deeper understanding and retention of the material presented. By integrating dynamic visuals in PowerPoint, interactive elements on a dedicated website, and both audio and video explanations, the project offers a comprehensive learning experience. These elements work together to simulate various language learning scenarios and present research findings in an innovative manner.
